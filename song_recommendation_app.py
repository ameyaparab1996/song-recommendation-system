        The songs we listen to can evoke nostalgia, lift our spirits, or simply provide the soundtrack to our daily routines. In the vast ocean of music, finding the perfect song can be like searching for hidden treasure. That's where personalized song recommendation systems come into play, offering a playlist of top songs that match the user's prompt and mood.
        
        This web application provides an interface for the user to input a prompt describing the type of songs or the mood they want to experience. Based on the user's input, the application employs NLP-based similarity algorithms to compare the lyrics of all the available songs in the database with the prompt, along with other features of the songs, to recommend suitable songs and build a playlist for the users.
