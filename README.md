# Personalized Song Recommendation System

This web application provides an interface for the user to input a prompt describing the type of songs or the mood they want to experience. Based on the user's input, the application employs NLP-based similarity algorithms to compare the lyrics of all the available songs in the database with the prompt, along with other features of the songs, to recommend suitable songs and build a playlist for the users.
